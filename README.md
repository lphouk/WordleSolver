# Wordle Solver and Analysis

This project involves the development of a Wordle solver in Python, utilizing a process of elimination and a filtering algorithm to deduce the hidden five-letter word based on feedback from the game. Additionally, the solver's performance was tested on 100 Wordle puzzles for each possible answer, followed by a statistical analysis to determine whether it could perform better with certain letter distributions.

## Dependencies

The Wordle solver was developed using Python and implemented in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The following libraries were utilized:

    pandas
    sklearn
    statsmodels
    matplotlib
    numpy

## Project Structure

    Logistic Regression.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation of a logistic regression model for the Wordle solver.

    WordleWolverData.py: This Python script generates the data used in the analysis. The solver plays 100 games per answer word, which is listed in AnswerWordList.txt.

    Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the exploratory data analysis for the Python solver.

## Usage

To use the Wordle solver, open the Logistic Regression.ipynb notebook and follow the instructions provided to input the feedback from the game and receive the predicted answer.

## Statistical Analysis

The project involved a statistical analysis of the solver's performance on 100 Wordle puzzles for each possible answer. This analysis aimed to determine whether the solver's performance varied significantly based on letter distributions in the hidden word.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis conducted in Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb includes histograms, scatter plots, and tables to gain insights into the data generated by the solver.
